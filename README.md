# NIT Rourkela-Data Structures and Alogrithm Design
All codes related to Data Structures and Algorithm Design class in NIT Rourkela will be uploaded. I apologize in advance for any delay in uploading anything or wrong information. Let me know if there is anything worth correcting and I will do it as soon as possible.

Enjoy!

## Directory Structure
The main directory contains 3 folders: 

- C++
- Java
- Python

Each folder will contain their respective projects. I will try to describe their directory structures in a separate README included with each folder.

## Dependencies
This project will contain C++, Java and Python codes for now. Will update here if this changes later on. For running codes in this project, JDK, JRE, Python, C++ compiler, debugger, header files, libraries, etc. will be needed. So based on your operating system install a suitable compiler. Tons of tutorials online.
