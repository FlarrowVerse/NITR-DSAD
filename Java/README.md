# Java Projects
This directory contains all the Java projects. For now it contains two related projects built using Maven for dependency and project management.

## Directory Structure
The main directory contains(will conatain) several folders: 

- _Main Project Folder_
    - *Sub-modules (if any)*
    - src/main/java/*project domain structure*
    - target
- _Main Project Related Folder_: might store data that can be saved and retrieved for later use
- run_project.sh
- run_project.bat
- run_project.ps1

Each folder will contain their respective projects. I will try to describe their directory structures in a separate README included with each folder.

## Dependencies
For now these projects are build with the help of Maven. I will try to learn and try to use Gradle later on, as, from what I understand, the learning curve is a bit steeper for Gradle.

## How to Use
I have made use of Launch4j application to create the executables for the applications. You can find both the configuration files for Launch4j and the executables in the *Launch4j-Configurations* directory and *Executables* directory under this folder.

Just double click to run them.
