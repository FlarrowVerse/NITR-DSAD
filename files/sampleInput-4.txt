The cat sat on the mat, and the cat looked at the rat. The rat was fat, and the cat had a hat. The bat flew by, and the bat saw the cat. The hat was red, and the cat was fed. The rat ran away, and the cat was sad. The sun was bright, and the moon was light. The day was warm, and the night was calm. The stars shone high, and the clouds were nigh. The rain fell down, and the streets were brown. The cars went fast, and the bikes went past. The kids played games, and the dogs chased names. The sky was blue, and the grass had dew. The flowers bloomed wide, and the bees buzzed side. The wind blew soft, and the birds flew aloft. The clock struck eight, and the dinner was late. The doorbell rang loud, and the guests made a crowd. The fire burned bright, and the stories took flight.
